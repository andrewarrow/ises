It's So Easy Slack

read and respond to slack messages from arch linux

in a terminal

with no window manager

but a nice console font

/ises u - unread
/ises t - tail last file messages of x
/ises s - speak
/ises e - edit last message

```
  445  ./ises -t 0 -id C0K5LNG2H                 # list message history from that id
  458  ./ises -p 1                               # list all people in all teams
  487  ./ises -t 0 -id U0FRP3RCN -s test         # say test in that place
```
